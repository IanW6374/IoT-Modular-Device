# IoT Modular Device (IoT-MD)

IoT-MD v2 is production firmware for secure, modular ESP32-S3 devices. One
device can host multiple sensors, switches and energy interfaces while exposing
a web portal, configurable MQTT messaging and a versioned HTTPS API. Home
Assistant is an optional built-in integration rather than a transport
requirement.

## Highlights

- Secure Boot v2, flash encryption and encrypted credential storage.
- Signed application, core and universal upgrades with anti-rollback, trial
  activation, health confirmation and recovery.
- Deterministic staged boot with capability, PSRAM, heap and watchdog gates;
  reset-persistent diagnostics identify the last completed startup stage.
- Responsive HTTPS portal with administrator, operator and viewer roles.
- Platform-neutral MQTT topics, optional Home Assistant discovery and
  mandatory-mTLS `/api/v2` access.
- Encrypted complete configuration backup and validated restore preview.
- NTP, IANA time zones, daylight-saving support and local-time energy resets.
- Structured audit, health and upgrade history with local and remote syslog.
- Resource-aware modular drivers with persistent calibration and diagnostics.
- Transport-neutral API contracts, bounded resource injection and centrally
  resolved feature flags.

## Supported modules

| Category | Drivers |
| --- | --- |
| Sensors | DHT11, HCSR04, Grove AC Voltage, MAX31865 PT1000 |
| Energy and HVAC | WHES, EMS Boiler, RS485 Modbus, multiport Modbus |
| Outputs | On/off and dimmer switches; on/off, brightness and RGB lights |

See the [module guide](docs/modules/README.md) for wiring, configuration,
entities and diagnostics for every supported module type. Complete example
configurations are in [`examples/`](examples/).

## Hardware and software

- ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8 with 8 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM and Wi-Fi.
- Experimental USB NCM application support in v2.5, capability-gated and
  unavailable on the current ESP32-S3 core; it is never required for setup,
  recovery or normal operation.
- MicroPython 1.29.0 built with ESP-IDF 5.5.1.
- Python 3.12 or newer for host tooling.
- ESP-IDF and the pinned MicroPython checkout for core builds.

The shipping partition layout provides dual secure core slots and a separate
encrypted application filesystem. Bluetooth, PPP and Ethernet are excluded
from the production core to preserve recovery capacity.

## First boot

Production devices are seeded with a signed factory image and a unique setup
password. Connect to the `IoT-MD-Setup-xxxxxx` Wi-Fi network, browse to
`http://192.168.4.1`, enter that password and complete the wizard.

The wizard configures:

1. device identity, Wi-Fi and network mode;
2. portal administrator credentials;
3. an administrator-selected certificate method: **Automatic IoT CA
   enrollment**, **IoT CA enrollment authorization (`.iotenroll`)**, **Private CA ACME
   enrollment**, **Manual certificate package**, or **Self-signed device certificate**; and
4. signed application installation and restart.

After setup, open the configured portal DNS name on port 8443. The device also
retains its `.local` mDNS name for private services. The Device API uses port
8444 by default and requires an enrolled client CA and certificate.

## Portal

The portal provides:

- status, module values and diagnostics;
- network, portal, time, MQTT, Device API and logging settings;
- module configuration, calibration and debug controls;
- users, role-aware permissions, per-user session expiry, sign-in lockout and
  forced replacement of administrator-issued passwords;
- application, core and universal upgrades;
- certificates, ACME, backup/restore, health history, device/audit logs, and
  non-destructive restart, shutdown or factory reset controls.

Settings that require a restart are committed immediately and collected behind
one banner action so several changes can be activated with one reboot.

Portal destinations use a shared navigation model and consistent terminology.
The top-level order is **Status**, **Device**, **Module**, **User** and
**Maintenance**; destinations inside each dropdown are alphabetical:

- **Device** contains Device API, logging, MQTT, network, portal and time/date
  settings.
- **Maintenance** contains click-to-expand certificate and logging categories,
  configuration backup, health history, Power & reset, and Upgrades.
- **Module** contains configuration and diagnostics; **Status** contains the
  live overview; **User** contains portal-user management. Password changes are
  opened from the signed-in user's avatar menu.

An **upgrade** is the act of installing software on a device. A **release** is
the signed artifact published by the Management Suite, and a **rollout** is the
fleet operation that assigns a release to devices. Compatibility-facing route,
configuration and code identifiers may continue to use `update`.

## Messaging and Home Assistant

MQTT base and state/command/response/availability topics are administrator
defined. The optional Home Assistant profile publishes discovery records that
refer to those same operational topics. Broker TLS verifies the exact hostname
configured under **Device > MQTT** against the certificate DNS/IP SAN;
the installed MQTT CA establishes trust but does not replace that identity
check. Retained module state is an MQTT broker feature, not persistence of
physical output state across a device restart. See the
[messaging guide](docs/MESSAGING.md).

Fleet and release services are provided by the separate public
[IoT-MD Management Suite](https://github.com/IanW6374/HA-IoT-MD-Management-Suite).
The generic IoT Certificate Authority and IoT Syslog remain independent
add-ons. See the [management ecosystem](docs/MANAGEMENT_SUITE.md).

## Upgrades

IoT-MD uses three signed artifact types:

| Extension | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.iotapp` | Replaceable application and selected drivers |
| `.iotcore` | Secure MicroPython core firmware |
| `.iotuni` | Matched application and core universal upgrade |

Use **Maintenance > Upgrades** for normal installation. Release sequences must
increase monotonically. Verification occurs before staging, and activation uses
trial health checks with rollback support. Automatic checks can be disabled or
scheduled daily/weekly in device-local time, independently of automatic
download and activation.

See the [upgrade guide](docs/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for release and USB recovery
procedures.

## Configuration and backup

Runtime policy is stored in `app_settings.json`; hardware modules are defined in
`module_settings.json`. Their JSON schemas are
[`app_settings.schema.json`](app_settings.schema.json) and
[`module_settings.schema.json`](module_settings.schema.json).

The portal can export ordinary configuration or a password-encrypted complete
backup containing credentials, certificates and trust material. Complete
backups remain sensitive and should be stored as securely as device keys.

## Development

Install host dependencies and run the complete validation suite:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 tools/check_repository_hygiene.py
python3 tools/check_documentation.py
python3 tools/validate_json_schemas.py
python3 tools/check_accessibility.py
python3 tools/check_architecture.py
python3 tools/check_micropython_compat.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
