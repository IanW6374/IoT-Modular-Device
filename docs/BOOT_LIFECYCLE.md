# Boot lifecycle and activation health

IoT-MD v2.4 and later use an explicit boot contract shared by the frozen recovery core
and replaceable application. The existing A/B application slots, dual OTA core
partitions and universal-update coordinator remain authoritative for selection,
confirmation and rollback.

## Stages

The boot record advances through these bounded stages:

1. `reset`
2. `platform`
3. `persistent-state`
4. `update-reconcile`
5. `filesystem`
6. `configuration`
7. `certificates`
8. `hardware`
9. `network`
10. `portal`
11. `essential-services`
12. `health-check`
13. `running`

`safe-mode` is a terminal diagnostic stage rather than a normal forward
transition. Every stage records the current and minimum observed free heap.

## Persistent record

The record contains its format version, boot, checkpoint-generation and failure
counters, incomplete and healthy flags, last stage, device state, reset cause,
paired-update state, heap observations and a bounded failure reason. The
generation counter selects the newest valid RTC or flash copy even when one
medium failed during the preceding checkpoint. The record never contains
credentials, private keys, tokens, configuration values or certificate
contents.

The custom ESP32-S3 firmware stores a CRC-protected copy in a 768-byte RTC
no-init region that survives software and watchdog resets. Power loss may leave
that region undefined, so its magic, format and CRC are always validated. An
atomic `.boot-state.json` checkpoint is retained as the fallback and durable
record.

V3 platform ABI 6 retains ABI 4's separate bounded recovery record in encrypted
NVS. The frozen supervisor advances it after handling any explicit factory
reset and before importing replaceable product code. The record contains only
request state, a bounded reason, boot/failure counters, a pending-health marker
and the ESP-IDF reset reason. Reaching application health clears the pending
marker and failure count; three consecutive incomplete normal boots select the
signed frozen recovery path.

ABI 6 also keeps an encrypted paired-release journal. The frozen supervisor
reconciles its prepared, trial or rollback phase before loading replaceable
product code. Native OTA confirmation requires the journal's expected runtime
slot to have reached the health gate. Rollback intent is durable before the
runtime slot is restored and the platform partition is rolled back.

## Device states

The transport-neutral lifecycle reports one of:

- `booting`
- `initialising`
- `running`
- `degraded`
- `safe`
- `restarting`
- `updating`

The portal, API inventory and support bundle consume this same state instead of
deriving independent interpretations.

## Trial activation gates

An application/core trial is confirmed only after:

- the ESP32-S3 exposes the expected PSRAM-backed heap;
- free MicroPython heap is above the activation floor;
- the home network is connected;
- the authenticated repair portal is listening when enabled; and
- the configured watchdog is operational.

The production N8R8 target requires at least 4 MiB of detected PSRAM, 1 MiB free
heap before application loading and 512 KiB at activation. These floors detect
the known internal-RAM-only firmware failure while leaving normal operational
headroom.

MQTT, NTP, Device API, Home Assistant, fleet and remote-syslog availability
depend on external systems or time. Failure of one of these services is
reported as `degraded`; it does not roll back an otherwise locally repairable
device.

## Failure policy

Update trials retain the aggressive two-unhealthy-boot rollback threshold.
Normal operation allows three incomplete boots before entering the frozen core
recovery console. Application exceptions, capability failures and health-gate
failures preserve the last stage, heap and bounded reason for USB, portal and
support-bundle diagnosis.

Startup Wi-Fi uses three bounded 20-second association attempts with two- and
five-second backoff. Each failed attempt resets the station association and is
logged. Only exhaustion of all three attempts latches the frozen recovery
request, so a single transient radio or access-point delay after a power cycle
does not strand an otherwise healthy remote device in recovery. A pending
network-settings trial retains its rollback behavior if all attempts fail.

Universal activation is firmware-first, so the new recovery core must boot
while the previous application generation is still mounted. Every
project-local module imported by the frozen recovery layer is therefore part
of the frozen-core dependency closure. The architecture check derives and
validates this closure from `firmware/manifest.py`; recovery code must never
depend on a helper supplied only by the matching application bundle.

## Toolchain boundary

v2.5 remains pinned to MicroPython 1.29.0 and ESP-IDF 5.5.1. Changing the SDK
major version during boot qualification would combine independent sources of
failure. ESP-IDF 6 evaluation is reserved for a future MicroPython alpha branch
after upstream support and a separate hardware qualification campaign exist.
