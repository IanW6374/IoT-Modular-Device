# IoT-MD v3 target architecture

## Status

This document defines the greenfield architecture under development on
`alpha/v3-platform-rewrite`. It is not the v2.5 runtime architecture and does
not change the stable release contract.

## Design objective

IoT-MD v3 is a secure embedded platform which hosts a replaceable MicroPython
product runtime. Native ESP-IDF code owns durable platform mechanisms;
MicroPython owns product policy and modular behavior. The boundary is explicit,
versioned, bounded and testable on the host.

## Native platform responsibilities

The native platform remains useful with no MicroPython application installed.
It owns secure boot and recovery selection, hardware identity, encrypted NVS,
filesystem mounting, watchdog state, OTA partitions, update verification,
paired trial/rollback state, native network interfaces and hardware capability
reporting. It exposes secret handles, never private key bytes.

Native code implements mechanism only. It does not know portal navigation,
MQTT topics, Home Assistant entities, module meaning, fleet rollout rules or
certificate enrollment policy.

## MicroPython runtime responsibilities

The runtime owns versioned configuration, service composition, module
contracts, driver behavior, health interpretation, portal/API/MQTT adapters,
certificate enrollment policy, fleet behavior and presentation. Its domain
services do not depend on sockets, HTTP or ESP-IDF types.

The runtime can request a native job and observe its result through a bounded
event record. It cannot select OTA partitions, write encrypted NVS internals,
extract keys or keep raw native pointers.

## Platform ABI

ABI 1 established capability discovery. ABI 2 added bounded encrypted-storage
handles and atomic whole-namespace snapshots. ABI 3 added owner-scoped logical
resource claims and bounded resource inventory. ABI 4 adds guarded OTA trial
observation/control, encrypted native boot/recovery state, and a fixed-capacity
native job/event queue. ABI 5 adds physical resource construction, safe bus
sharing, interrupt ownership and peripheral recovery. ABI 6 adds the encrypted
paired-release journal which binds a release sequence, platform partition and
runtime slot across trial, confirmation and rollback. The ABI follows these
rules:

- primitive values only: bounded strings, integers, booleans, bytes and maps;
- explicit maximum size and timeout for every call;
- opaque integer handles for secrets and long-lived native resources;
- no silent fallback when a capability or ABI version is unavailable;
- structured error code, operation, retryability and diagnostic context;
- capability discovery separate from feature enablement; and
- backwards compatibility within one major ABI, with additive optional fields.

An Alpha 2 namespace commit writes a CRC-protected generation to the inactive
of two NVS snapshot slots and commits it before it can supersede the prior
generation. The runtime supplies the generation it read, so concurrent or
stale commits fail rather than overwrite newer state. Recovery validates both
slots and chooses the newest complete generation. Payloads are capped at 4096
bytes and native handles—not ESP-IDF NVS objects—cross the boundary.

The checked-in JSON schemas are executable documentation for host tooling. The
native module and runtime adapter will share generated constants or one source
definition where practical.

ABI 4 job submission never waits for queue capacity. The worker accepts a
bounded allow-list of recovery and OTA trial operations, holds no MicroPython
object across its FreeRTOS boundary, and returns fixed-size events containing an
identifier, state, numeric error, retryability and diagnostic detail. Queue
saturation fails immediately; an unconsumed event queue drops its oldest
diagnostic rather than blocking a platform operation. The capability contract
declares a five-second operation bound.

ABI 5 accepts only explicit physical parameters from configuration contract
version 4. GPIO, ADC, UART, I2C and SPI constructors stay native; MicroPython
receives opaque claim handles. GPIO, ADC and UART are exclusive. I2C and SPI
may be shared only when the claim signature and effective pin, frequency and
DMA parameters match. Cleanup removes interrupt handlers and releases the
ESP-IDF driver. Recovery tears down and rebuilds the physical instance, while
GPIO edge observations enter the existing fixed-capacity event queue. Runtime
resource-manager construction first invokes a native reset so a prior abrupt
MicroPython restart cannot retain stale claims or peripheral drivers.

ABI 6 is the atomic pair boundary. The frozen supervisor prepares and begins a
pair only when the expected platform partition is running. It calls the native
ABI through a frozen adapter, never through an application-slot module that may
not yet be importable. The replaceable
runtime marks its exact slot healthy; only then may native code confirm the
ESP-IDF OTA image. The durable application pointer remains on the prior slot
until that native confirmation succeeds. A failed runtime records rollback
intent before its trial slot is discarded and native bootloader rollback is
requested. A higher signed sequence may replace a stale journal from a rejected
trial. The journal is re-read after interruption, so an incomplete transition
cannot silently become a confirmed mixed pair. Production capability flags
remain false until the power-cut HIL matrix demonstrates this behavior at every
transition.

## Application kernel

The Alpha 3 kernel validates or previews migration before it creates a service
or claims hardware. Its registry resolves service dependencies deterministically
and its cooperative supervisor isolates transient failures as degraded state,
records a bounded event, and permits an individual service restart. A failed
boot stops every started service and releases owner-scoped claims before it
enters recovery.

The initial reference sensor is deliberately small: it proves the driver,
resource and lifecycle contracts without making a production claim for a new
physical sensor. Its sample source is injectable for host and HIL fixtures.
Alpha 4 registers product transports through the same dependency-aware service
registry. Configuration contract version 2 declares adapter identity,
dependencies and criticality; socket or client instances are injected at the
outer edge and never enter configuration or support snapshots.

MQTT receives only a bounded state projection and provides a separate optional
Home Assistant discovery operation. The server-rendered portal and Device API
share bounded request/response values while retaining distinct authentication:
the portal uses roles and the API requires a verified mTLS identity with an
explicit scope. Navigation and form fields come from shared metadata rather
than duplicated page definitions.

Connectivity diagnostics rotate one bounded probe at a time across DNS, time,
TLS, MQTT, CA, syslog and release services. They report operational state and
the exception class only. This preserves useful fault isolation without
turning a support snapshot into a credential or endpoint-detail export.

Alpha 5 advances the runtime configuration contract to version 3. Identity and
fleet are explicit dependency-ordered domain services rather than special cases
inside a transport. The portal and Device API render their bounded projections;
certificate, socket and fleet-client implementations stay behind injected
adapters.

The identity service represents portal, Device API/fleet and renewal identities
with opaque certificate and key handles. It orchestrates all supported
enrollment methods, checks renewal only with a synchronized clock and never
renews a manual package. Trust anchors are purpose-labelled and removed using
their observed generation so a stale page cannot delete a replacement anchor.
Neither snapshots nor API responses contain certificate or private-key bytes.

Alpha 9 connects these contracts to production-facing adapters. Wi-Fi owns
station activation and bounded reconnect scheduling; MQTT and syslog bridge
their asynchronous clients; HTTPS portal and mTLS Device API listeners share a
lifecycle adapter while retaining different authentication policy. The
identity bridge reads the installed flash-encrypted certificate files, maps
their internal locators to stable opaque integers in encrypted transactional
NVS, dispatches the established enrollment/renewal implementations and applies
generation checks before trust removal. This is a shadow/integration boundary,
not active-v3 cutover or a claim that private-key bytes have moved into NVS.

Alpha 10 supplies the outer production composition root. It connects the
transport, identity, fleet, migration, driver and qualification services to the
cutover coordinator without moving policy into native code. Shadow mode uses a
dedicated side-effect-free runtime: it validates configuration and compares
bounded compatibility projections but cannot open sockets, publish state or
claim peripherals. Active mode still fails closed until native qualification
flags and all release-bound observed gates pass; a failed active boot latches
the requested mode back to compatibility.

Alpha 11 adds the executable bootstrap around that composition root and closes
three reboot boundaries found during universal-update testing. The application
reported during trial is the slot actually executing, but its durable active
pointer still moves only after health confirmation. If the bootloader rejects
the paired core after that application pointer was committed, frozen universal
reconciliation restores the journalled previous runtime slot. Native pair
confirmation is persisted only after the running OTA partition reads back as
valid. Interrupted cutover startup latches compatibility, while a previously
healthy running phase is converted to a fresh gated boot. Migration staging
persists a native handle intent before writing secret material, permitting
deterministic orphan cleanup after power loss.

The fleet service accepts only signed P-256 policy targeted to the device or
its configured cohort. It rejects unknown fields, invalid time windows, replayed
sequences and unsynchronized clocks before saving policy transactionally.
Canary outcomes increment a bounded failure count and pause rollout at the
signed policy threshold. Its report contains only bounded inventory, release,
health, canary and event-cursor values. The transport supplies policy and carries
reports; it does not decide whether policy is valid.

Kernel health and support snapshots have fixed collection limits and contain
only operational state. Runtime configuration and module settings are excluded
so these snapshots cannot become an accidental secret-export path.

## Integration cutover and qualification

Alpha 6 introduced one persistent cutover coordinator rather than allowing a
build flag to select the greenfield runtime. Compatibility is the durable
default. Shadow mode starts the compatibility path and an isolated v3 kernel;
active mode starts only v3, but is rejected unless the platform reports native
paired trial and rollback and the current release-bound qualification record is
fully passing. A boot exception or failed runtime health check requests recovery
and persistently returns requested and effective ownership to compatibility. A
subsequent v3 attempt therefore requires a new explicit operator request.

Qualification is an evidence contract, not a derived marketing status. The
ledger resets when release version or monotonic sequence changes. Offline
probes contribute network observations but never fabricated service-health or
storage samples. The beta profile also requires 2,400 health and storage
observations during its 48-hour soak, so one late sample cannot qualify the
period. Unexecuted tests remain `not-run`; observed failures are sticky until
an explicit campaign reset. USB NCM is not a promotion dependency while the
ESP32-S3 MicroPython integration remains unsupported.

Alpha 7 moves recovery intent and incomplete-boot counting into encrypted NVS
and advances that record from the frozen boot supervisor before importing the
replaceable product. An explicit factory reset retains precedence. Three
consecutive boots which fail to reach the health marker enter the signed frozen
recovery path; a healthy application clears the pending marker. This is
product-independent recovery, not recovery independent of the signed
MicroPython core. A corrupted confirmed core still depends on bootloader A/B
behavior or USB disaster recovery.

## Release and recovery model

Users install one universal release containing independently signed platform
and runtime components plus an outer pairing manifest. The device has confirmed
and trial state for both layers. Confirmation is atomic from the product's
perspective: failure of either required layer rolls the pair back.

The frozen/native recovery path accepts signed v3 releases, reports diagnostics
and restores a confirmed pair without importing the product runtime. Separate
component artifacts remain available for factory and recovery workflows, not as
the ordinary operator upgrade sequence.

The paired state contract distinguishes `staging`, `ready`, `trial`,
`confirmed` and `rollback`. ABI 6 adds a native journal below that runtime
state, binds both selected components and permits native confirmation only after
the expected runtime reaches its health gate. Runtime rollback is performed
before native bootloader rollback. `paired_trial` and `native_rollback`
capabilities nevertheless remain false until the interruption matrix proves the
complete mechanism on hardware.

## Configuration migration

V3 has a new configuration namespace and schema. Importing a v2 encrypted
backup produces a preview, validation report and migration plan. The confirmed
v2 state remains untouched until v3 trial health succeeds. Rollback therefore
returns to both the v2 software and its original configuration.

Alpha 5 implements the runtime coordinator for an already authenticated and
decrypted v2 complete backup. The preview is fingerprint-bound and records only
section counts, warnings and a plan identifier. Credentials, module settings
and certificate/trust files are staged by a platform adapter and represented by
opaque handles. A healthy v3 trial activates those handles; an unhealthy trial
discards them. Atomic native activation and representative-device rollback are
still qualification gates, so this coordinator is not yet the production
restore path.

## Hardware and resource model

Drivers request logical resources. The runtime resource service checks product
policy while the native platform owns physical GPIO, ADC, UART, I2C, SPI and
interrupt allocation. Compatible shared buses use one native instance; unsafe
conflicts fail before a driver starts.

ABI 3 introduced the ownership ledger for ADC, GPIO, I2C, SPI and UART
identities. ABI 5 constructs those physical resources, owns GPIO interrupt
registration and cleanup, and provides bounded recovery after driver failure
or a MicroPython service restart. Claims use opaque integer handles, are
idempotent for the same owner, conflict across different owners, and can be
released individually or by owner. I2C/SPI sharing requires both an identical
configuration signature and identical effective native parameters; other
resource kinds cannot be shared.

Alpha 5 permits each module to declare up to eight resources and adds a static
catalog matching all supported v2.5 driver backends and module type variants.
A driver claims the complete set before starting its injected hardware backend;
failed start and stop release the whole owner scope. Dynamic unsigned driver
loading remains out of scope, and the catalog is a compatibility declaration—not
evidence that every physical backend has passed v3 HIL qualification. The ABI
5 constructors are likewise advertised as implemented but `qualified: false`
until that complete matrix passes. Alpha 10 adds a checked translation from all
13 supported v2 module variants into the v3 driver/resource declarations. The
translation is not a substitute for exercising every injected physical backend
on hardware.

The initial target remains ESP32-S3 N8R8. A future production board should
prefer 16 MB flash and 8 MB PSRAM, but larger hardware must not become an alpha
prerequisite until partition and migration policy are decided.

## Security invariants

- Production secure boot, flash encryption and encrypted NVS are mandatory.
- Release, fleet-policy and certificate trust domains use distinct keys.
- Portal and private-service identities remain independent.
- Device API access remains mutual TLS with registered fingerprint and scope.
- Recovery cannot accept unsigned code or bypass credential policy.
- Debug and alpha capability cannot be enabled by a runtime symbol alone.
