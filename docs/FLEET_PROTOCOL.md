# IoT-MD fleet protocol v1

The independently released
[IoT-MD Management Suite](https://github.com/IanW6374/HA-IoT-MD-Management-Suite)
uses the device's `/api/v3` endpoints over mandatory mutual TLS.

The v3 alpha boundary retains the same trust and policy semantics while adding
a bounded `/api/v3/fleet/report` projection and `/api/v3/fleet/policy` intake.
The former requires `fleet:read`; the latter requires `fleet:write`. These are
Alpha 5 contract routes and do not replace the production v2 endpoints until
Management Suite interoperability and HIL security tests pass.

## Identity and inventory

Fleet clients use dedicated certificates with `fleet:read` and optional
`fleet:write` scopes. Device identity is the immutable factory identifier plus
certificate identity; hostnames are display and routing attributes.

The combined inventory route remains available for existing managers. New
fleet clients should use `/api/v3/device`, `/interfaces`, `/hardware`, and
`/services`, retrieving module catalog and health only when required. This
reduces peak device JSON allocation while reporting the same product,
application/core versions, release sequences, board, capabilities, drivers,
health and transport state. `/api/v3/configuration` contains only a bounded
non-secret operating summary. No endpoint returns credentials, private keys or
password verifiers.

## Signed policy

Fleet policy has an independent ECDSA P-256 key. The manager stores the private
key and devices store only the 64-byte public key. A policy binds:

- sequence, issue time, validity window, device/cohort and target board;
- local maintenance days, start time and duration;
- update channel, download/activation controls and failure threshold;
- telemetry interval/severity and bounded command identifiers.

Devices reject invalid signatures, replayed sequences, incorrect targets,
expired policies, unknown fields and policies requiring an unsynchronised
clock. Alpha 5 additionally keeps the accepted sequence and rollout outcome in
a transactional namespace. Fleet policy can select signed releases but cannot
create firmware.

## Events and rollouts

Events use a monotonic cursor and explicitly report retention gaps. Rollouts
advance through ordered cohorts only after required success results and stop at
their configured failure threshold. Alpha 5 reports `healthy`, `confirmed`,
`failed` or `rolled-back` canary outcomes and pauses after the signed consecutive
failure threshold. Rollback references a previously confirmed signed release.
