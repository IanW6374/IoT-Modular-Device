# Grove AC Voltage

## Hardware and configuration

Use `class: sensor` and `subclass: Grove-AC-Voltage`. The `ac_voltage` object
selects `adc_pin` and controls RMS sampling (`vref`, `adc_max`, `sample_count`,
`sample_delay_us`), conversion (`calibration`, `offset`, `precision`) and the
optional presence threshold (`threshold`, `hysteresis`, `threshold_key`). The
sampling defaults are 600 samples, 200 µs spacing, calibration 700, a 180 V
threshold and 5 V hysteresis. `pollinterval` defaults to five seconds.

Always configure `adc_pin` explicitly for the production
ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N8R8. The driver's legacy GPIO 26 fallback is not suitable
for that board because its octal flash/PSRAM reserves GPIO 26. The standalone
example uses ADC-capable GPIO 1; the HTW example uses GPIO 4. Confirm the chosen
pin against the board schematic and every other configured module.

The main `voltage` entity can be accompanied by `ac_present`, ADC and error
diagnostics. Calibrate from **Module > Diagnostics** using a trusted meter; the
calculated multiplier is committed atomically to module configuration, read
back before success is reported, and shown in diagnostics. The previous
settings generation remains available if the transaction fails. Start from the complete
[example configuration](../../examples/module_settings.grove_ac_voltage.example.json).

## State, commands and diagnostics

State resembles `{"voltage":230.4,"ac_present":true}` and is identical over
MQTT, API and optional HA discovery. Calibration commands are privileged module
operations; ordinary clients should treat the module as read-only. Hysteresis
prevents presence chatter around the threshold. Diagnostics expose raw ADC/RMS,
calibration and sampling errors.

This module measures mains-derived signals. Use only an appropriately isolated,
rated sensor assembly, fusing and enclosure. IoT-MD readings are operational,
not certified revenue or protective measurements.
