# Certificate identities and provisioning

IoT-MD deliberately separates browser-facing and service-facing trust.

| Purpose | Identity or trust | Expected issuer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web portal HTTPS | `web.crt.pem` / `web.key.der` | Selected setup method: public ACME, private CA, self-signed or manual |
| Device API and fleet server | `api-server.crt.der` / `api-server.key.der` | Private IoT CA for the device `.local` name |
| MQTT server authentication | `mqtt-ca.der` trust anchor | Broker leaf must chain to the installed CA |
| Release server authentication | `update-ca.der` | Private CA used by the release service |
| Syslog server authentication | Dedicated Syslog trusted CA | Private CA used by IoT Syslog |
| API/fleet clients | One or more API client CAs and enrolled client certificates | Private IoT CA |

The public certificate is limited to the human-facing portal. The private
Device API/fleet identity is presented only by the inbound mutual-TLS Device API
endpoint. MQTT, release/upgrade and Syslog are outbound TLS clients: they do not
present the Device API/fleet identity and instead validate their remote servers
using the corresponding installed CA trust anchors.

## TLS names and certificate chains

A trusted issuer and a matching service identity are both required. IoT-MD
verifies the exact configured hostname against a certificate DNS SAN, or an IP
literal against an IP SAN. When a SAN extension exists, a matching Common Name
alone is not sufficient. For example, a broker configured as
`homeassistant.local` needs that DNS SAN even if its certificate Common Name is
`mqtt-broker.home.arpa`; alternatively configure the broker using the latter
name and ensure DNS resolves it.

Servers must present their leaf certificate and required intermediate
certificates. The IoT-MD trust file normally contains the issuing root; adding
that root does not repair a missing intermediate or bypass hostname checks.
After replacing a broker, syslog, release or API certificate, reload the
service and inspect the certificate actually presented on its network port.

Public portal names such as `iot-md-001.iot.example.com` and private service names
such as `iot-md-001.local` are intentionally separate. A public portal certificate
does not replace the private Device API/fleet identity or any outbound service trust
anchor.

## Initial setup choices

The first-boot wizard starts with a certificate-route selector and displays
only the fields for the selected route:

1. **Automatic IoT CA enrollment** obtains a browser-trusted portal
   certificate and a private-CA Device API/fleet identity through a short-lived,
   trusted-LAN enrollment window.
2. **IoT CA enrollment authorization (`.iotenroll`)** obtains the same identity
   set from a one-time, host-bound authorization downloaded by the admin.
3. **Private CA ACME enrollment** uses the device's `.local` name and HTTP-01 against
   the private IoT CA.
4. **Manual certificate package** uploads an existing public portal chain/key
   and private Device API/fleet certificate/key.
5. **Self-signed device certificate** keeps the device-generated local fallback.

No route is silently applied. Selecting **Self-signed device certificate** requires no
certificate fields and continues with the identity created during the network
step.

## Maintenance certificate pages

The authenticated portal separates certificate material by role so that a
trust anchor is not mistaken for a device or client identity:

- **Certificate enrollment** shows the active enrollment method and its renewal
  behaviour. An administrator can change to **Self-signed device certificate**,
  **Automatic IoT CA enrollment**, **IoT CA enrollment authorization
  (`.iotenroll`)**, **Private CA ACME enrollment**, or **Manual certificate
  package**. Only the controls for the selected method are displayed.
- **CA & signing trust** contains the outbound **MQTT broker CA**, **Release
  server CA**, **Syslog server CA**, and **Management Suite signing key**. Each
  installed item can be removed explicitly. Removing a CA prevents the related
  TLS client from reconnecting until replacement trust is installed.
- **API client trust** contains **Device API client issuer CA** anchors and
  enrolled **Device API caller certificates**. Removing an issuer CA reloads
  Device API trust; revoking a caller removes only that enrolled caller.
- **Device certificates** inventories identities currently
  presented by the device: **Portal HTTPS identity** and **Device API and fleet
  server identity**. It also exposes **Renew now** for the current managed
  enrollment method. Identities are installed or replaced from **Certificate
  enrollment**. **Manual certificate package** remains the only method without
  automatic renewal and therefore requires an explicit replacement package.

The Management Suite verification key is a signing key rather than an X.509
CA certificate. It verifies fleet policy and format-3 release catalogs; update
artifacts remain independently verified by the immutable offline update key.

## V3 identity boundary

The v3 Alpha 5 runtime keeps the same user-facing enrollment methods and split
identity model, but does not move certificate or private-key bytes through the
application kernel. Platform adapters return opaque integer handles plus
bounded subject, issuer, fingerprint and validity metadata. The identity domain
orchestrates enrollment and renewal; the platform owns protected material and
cryptographic operations. Trust anchors are removed by identifier and observed
generation to prevent a stale portal operation from deleting newer trust.

This is currently an alpha contract. The v2.5 certificate implementation
remains the active product path until real issuance, renewal, power interruption
and trust-removal HIL tests qualify the native adapter.

### Renewal coverage

Renewal depends on the selected route and is shown beside every choice in the
wizard:

- **Private CA ACME enrollment** automatically renews its local portal certificate
  after two-thirds of its lifetime. It does not install or rotate a separate
  Device API/fleet identity.
- **Automatic IoT CA enrollment** and **IoT CA enrollment authorization (`.iotenroll`)**
  install the public portal, private Device API and renewal identities together.
  The device uses the renewal identity to rotate the complete set automatically
  after two-thirds of either server certificate lifetime.
- **Manual certificate package** certificates are replaced manually; neither the public nor
  private identity is auto-renewed.
- **Self-signed device certificate** mode regenerates its local identity automatically
  after two-thirds of its lifetime.

## Automatic IoT CA enrollment

For one-step provisioning, configure IoT CA with a server name the device can
resolve (by default `iot-ca.home.arpa`) and ensure its Home Assistant network
mapping matches the configured provisioning port (9010 by default). Open the
automatic IoT-MD enrollment window from the CA Overview; it closes after the
configured interval, five minutes by default. In the device wizard, leave the
server and port blank to use those defaults or enter the matching values, then
choose **Request and install certificates**. The CA accepts only private-LAN
requests, rate-limits them, audits each authorization and derives both
identities from the device's `<host>.local` name.

The private-CA ACME route similarly treats a blank directory URL as
`https://iot-ca.home.arpa:9000/acme/acme/directory`. If the CA/ACME port is
remapped from 9000 in Home Assistant, enter the corresponding URL instead.

The first automatic exchange is a trusted-LAN bootstrap because the device
does not yet possess the private root. The returned authorization pins all
subsequent enrollment traffic to that root. On an untrusted setup LAN, choose
**Authorize IoT-MD** in IoT CA, enter the portal host label and download the
resulting `.iotenroll` file instead. That authorization expires after 30
minutes and can be claimed only once with the same certificate requests.

Select **IoT CA enrollment authorization (`.iotenroll`)** and upload that one
file. The device pins HTTPS to the private root embedded in the file,
generates independent P-256 keys for the portal, Device API and renewal
identity, and submits only their CSRs. IoT CA completes Cloudflare DNS-01 for
the portal CSR and signs the API and renewal CSRs with its private authority.
The returned response contains certificates and public trust only. It never
contains a private key or Cloudflare token.

The Device API and fleet server identity is installed as a leaf-plus-intermediate PEM
chain (the filename remains the established API certificate path), allowing
clients that trust the private root to validate the complete chain.

The device checks that the authorization's `.local` API hostname matches the
name selected earlier in setup, verifies each certificate/key pair, and
commits the complete set with rollback protection.

## Manual public profile provisioning

Issue an **IoT-MD public portal** profile in IoT Certificate Authority before
starting device provisioning. The CA performs Cloudflare DNS-01 and returns a
one-time ZIP. Unzip it on the administrator workstation; do not copy the ZIP or
Cloudflare credentials to the device.

On the first-boot **Install device certificates** page, select:

1. the private IoT root as **Home IoT trusted CA**;
2. the public portal DNS hostname;
3. `web.crt.pem` (leaf plus intermediate chain) and `web.key.der` for the public portal;
4. `api-server.crt.der` and `api-server.key.der` for private API/fleet service.

The device validates both key pairs before committing the certificate set. Its
`.local` mDNS hostname remains separate from the public portal DNS name, so API
clients can continue to use private name resolution and private CA validation.

The manual route installs an already-issued profile package. The automated
route contacts IoT CA, not Cloudflare, and neither route stores a Cloudflare
token on the device. An unprovisioned field device never receives DNS-edit
authority.

## Upgrades from 2.1.1

When the independent Device API/fleet identity files are absent, the first boot after
upgrade copies the existing portal identity once so that the API remains
reachable. The Certificates page marks this as an upgrade identity. Install a
private-CA Device API and fleet server certificate and key to clear the warning. Future
portal certificate changes never update the API identity.

Complete encrypted backups include both identities. Restore validates each
certificate/key pair before activation.
