# IoT-MD upgrade and recovery guide

## V3 alpha qualification

V3 alpha packages are recovery-device test releases, not stable fleet
upgrades. They retain the v2.5 compatibility product runtime while the new
native/runtime boundaries are qualified. Use the release-specific test note,
including its monotonically increasing sequence and open HIL gates, before
installing one.

Alpha 15 uses the Alpha 13 universal update path and further simplifies the
operator-facing manual workflow without changing its signed staging or
activation semantics. The file selector is hidden after staging begins, Cancel
returns to selection, and one progress area complements the file-specific
vertical workflow. Alpha 14 introduced that file-specific preview and
**Upload and stage** action. Alpha 13 requires a universal install because it
upgrades activating transaction state
written by older frozen coordinators before invoking the native ABI. It retains
Alpha 12's direct frozen pair preparation, native-first confirmation,
failure persistence and stale-journal handling while retaining platform ABI 6
and runtime configuration version 4. Alpha 11 added mixed-pair rollback restoration,
durable migration staging, interrupted-cutover reconciliation and the product
bootstrap. Alpha 10 added the encrypted paired journal, frozen reconciliation
and remaining-gate composition, shadow, migration and driver bridges. Alpha 9 added
physical resource construction/recovery plus production transport and identity
bridges.
These mechanisms are visible under **Maintenance > Release qualification**, but
remain explicitly unqualified until the Alpha 9 HIL and interoperability matrix
passes. Alpha 7's guarded OTA trial controls, native recovery state and bounded
job/event boundary also remain unqualified pending their HIL matrix. Alpha 6
added the release-bound 15-gate evidence record and remains on
the compatibility runtime until native paired rollback and every recorded gate
pass. Alpha 5 can preview an already
authenticated/decrypted v2 complete backup and
stage its credentials, module settings and certificate/trust material into an
isolated v3 namespace. Preview does not mutate the backup or confirmed v2 state.
Staged handles are activated only after a healthy v3 trial and discarded after
an unhealthy trial. Until the native atomic-activation and representative-device
rollback gate passes, use the existing v2 restore workflow for production data.

The ordinary artifact remains one `.iotuni` paired release. Alpha component
artifacts are published for factory and recovery diagnosis, and installation
of an older release sequence may require USB recovery or a newer signed build.

## Artifact types

- `.iotapp`: application and selected drivers.
- `.iotcore`: secure MicroPython core firmware.
- `.iotuni`: matched application and core for one coordinated upgrade.
- `.factory.bin`: device seeding and USB disaster recovery only.

Every deployable artifact is signed with ECDSA P-256/SHA-256, identifies its
source revision and carries a monotonically increasing release sequence.

## Portal upgrade

### Transition from v2.0.x

The v2.1 formats and encrypted configuration namespace are intentionally a clean
break. Do not use a universal container while crossing this boundary. On the
existing v2.0.13 test device, install and restart after every component:

1. `application-2.0.15.hamd`
2. `ham-core-2.0.15.hamf`
3. `ham-core-2.0.16.hamf`
4. `application-2.1.1.iotapp`
5. `iotmd-core-2.1.1.iotcore`

If the device already reports application v2.0.15 and core v2.0.16, begin at
step 4. The transition application copies and byte-verifies the encrypted
configuration while retaining the v2.0 namespace for rollback. v2.0.16 allows
the frozen recovery supervisor to validate and boot the `iotmd.py` entry point.
Current production bundles retain that small source bootstrap for compatibility
and precompile the substantial runtime as `iotmd_runtime.mpy`, avoiding a large
contiguous source-compilation allocation during trial boot.

1. Back up the current configuration.
2. Open **Maintenance > Upgrades**.
3. Upload the artifact and wait for upload, verification and staging to finish.
4. Review the staged type and version.
5. Activate and reboot.
6. Wait for trial health confirmation and verify the running application/core
   versions on the overview page.

For universal uploads, the portal reports transport and trust operations as
different phases. **Checking uploaded core/application bytes** validates that
the resumable transfer matches the release manifest. **Verifying signed core
firmware/application** then validates the signed component itself. These are
separate operations; each signed component is installed and verified once.

All three upload types are resumable. Retrying the same `.iotapp`, `.iotcore` or
`.iotuni` continues from its last committed 64 KiB chunk; selecting a different
artifact discards the interrupted upload and reclaims its storage. The portal
rejects an artifact before accepting bytes when the complete upload cannot fit
with the required storage reserve.

Universal format 3 does not store the combined container on the device. The
browser submits its small signed outer manifest first; the device then accepts
the exact signed core and application bundles sequentially. The core is written
and read-back verified in the inactive OTA partition before the application is
adopted in place. Only after both required components match the signed outer
version, release sequence, size and SHA-256 values does the device expose paired
activation. The persistent plan and normal resumable offsets survive a browser
refresh or interrupted connection.

The one-time transition from a core/application that predates sequential
transport requires the new `.iotapp` first. Restart and confirm that application,
then upload the matching `.iotuni`; the portal skips the already-installed
application and stages the core from the universal container. Once that core is
confirmed, later format-3 `.iotuni` releases can upgrade both components directly.

Do not interrupt power during core activation. A rejected or failed artifact
must remain visibly failed in the portal; consult the structured log for its
reason.

### Automatic release checks

**Maintenance > Upgrades > Automatic upgrade** separates an immediate manual
check from saved scheduling preferences. A schedule can be disabled, daily at
the selected device-local time, or weekly at the selected weekday and local
time. The device time zone is configured under **Device > Time / Date**.

User-facing terminology is deliberately consistent across IoT-MD and its
management services: an **upgrade** installs a newer signed version, a
**release** is a published artifact in the Management Suite, and a **rollout**
applies a release to a fleet. Existing HTTP routes, configuration keys and
source identifiers containing `update` remain stable for compatibility.

**Automatically download applicable signed releases** and **Automatically
activate verified releases** are independent settings. A check without
automatic download only reports availability; a download without automatic
activation leaves the verified release staged for an administrator. Fleet
policy can additionally prevent automatic activation while a rollout is paused
or outside its maintenance window. Manual uploads remain available regardless
of the automatic check schedule.

## Production build

Build only from a clean, tested commit. This example uses stable version
`2.5.0` and release sequence `2705`:

```sh
python3 tools/build_update.py releases/v2.5.0/application-2.5.0.iotapp \
  --version 2.5.0 --release-sequence 2705 \
  --signing-key /secure/update.signing-key \
  --mpy-cross /path/to/micropython/mpy-cross/build/mpy-cross

python3 tools/build_micropython_firmware.py \
  --micropython-root /path/to/micropython \
  --version 2.5.0 --release-sequence 2705 \
  --output releases/v2.5.0/iotmd-core-2.5.0.iotcore \
  --factory-output /secure-output/iotmd-core-2.5.0.factory.bin \
  --signing-key /secure/update.signing-key --production-security \
  --secure-boot-signing-key /secure/secure-boot-signing-key.pem \
  --factory-setup-password-output /secure-output/device-v2.5.0.setup-password.txt

python3 tools/build_universal_update.py \
  releases/v2.5.0/universal-2.5.0.iotuni \
  --application releases/v2.5.0/application-2.5.0.iotapp \
  --firmware releases/v2.5.0/iotmd-core-2.5.0.iotcore \
  --version 2.5.0 --release-sequence 2705 \
  --activation-order firmware-first \
  --signing-key /secure/update.signing-key
```

Production application bundles compile importable modules, including the full
`iotmd_runtime` module, to `.mpy` bytecode. Only the compact recovery-compatible
entry point and source-provenance module remain readable Python. The
universal builder enforces a 1.5 MiB limit on each sequential component rather
than claiming that an arbitrary combined size is safe on a populated filesystem.

Generate SBOM and provenance with `tools/generate_sbom.py` and
`tools/generate_provenance.py`. Store private keys and setup-password outputs
outside any public release site.

## Clean USB reseed

A reseed erases application state, settings, credentials, certificates and
logs. Use the exact serial device and acknowledge erasure explicitly:

```sh
python3 tools/reseed_device_usb.py \
  --device /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX \
  --bundle releases/v2.2.9/iotmd-core-2.2.9.iotcore \
  --application-bundle releases/v2.2.9/application-2.2.9.iotapp \
  --micropython-root /path/to/micropython \
  --setup-password-file /secure-output/device-v2.1.setup-password.txt \
  --update-signing-key /secure/update.signing-key \
  --confirm-erase-user-state
```

After reseeding, complete first-boot setup and restore a validated encrypted
backup if required.

## Qualification

Before publication, run all repository checks and execute:

```sh
python3 tools/hil_qualify.py --host device.local \
  --ca ca.pem --cert client.pem --key client-key.pem \
  --output qualification.json
```

Also verify first boot, portal/API TLS, MQTT, interrupted upload, low-storage
cleanup, universal activation, watchdog recovery, rollback and configuration
restore on production-equivalent hardware.

For the v3 campaign, initialise or inspect a persistent host record with:

```sh
python3 v3/host/qualification_runner.py \
  --state .qualification/alpha10.state.json \
  --evidence .qualification/alpha10.evidence.json \
  --device-id iot-md-001 --version 3.0.0-alpha.15 --sequence 2720 status
```

Monitor health over the mTLS Device API using the applicable JSON field paths:

```sh
python3 v3/host/qualification_runner.py \
  --state .qualification/alpha10.state.json \
  --evidence .qualification/alpha10.evidence.json \
  --device-id iot-md-001 --version 3.0.0-alpha.15 --sequence 2720 monitor \
  --url https://iot-md-001.local:8444/api/v2/device \
  --ca-file home-iot-ca.pem --cert-file client.pem --key-file client-key.pem \
  --health-path device.qualification_observation.health_state \
  --storage-path device.qualification_observation.storage_free_bytes \
  --duration 172800 --interval 60
```

Controlled events are explicit subcommands: `renewal`, `update`, `power`, or
`validation --gate <name>`, each with a required success/failure outcome. The
tool exits 2 while any gate remains open or failed and 0 only when promotion is
ready. A connection failure is recorded as network-down evidence only.

Release-specific reports are indexed in
[`docs/qualification`](qualification/README.md).
