# IoT-MD v3 greenfield alpha

This directory is the isolated starting point for the v3 architecture rewrite.
Stable v2.5 maintenance continues from `main`; v3 development continues on
`alpha/v3-platform-rewrite` until its own promotion gates pass.

Version `3.0.0-alpha.12` retains native ABI 6 and makes paired confirmation
power-loss safe across core generations. Frozen code prepares the native trial
without importing an application-slot adapter, native confirmation precedes the
durable application pointer, failures retain their exact phase, and a newer
signed pair can replace a stale trial journal. Alpha 11's interrupted-cutover
reconciliation, durable migration, independent v3 driver translation and
executable product bootstrap remain. These are implemented mechanisms, not
completed qualification claims; compatibility remains active until
release-bound HIL and shadow evidence is complete.

The rewrite keeps the proven product requirements while establishing the
native ESP-IDF platform and MicroPython application boundary before porting
features. Existing v2 code is reference behavior, not a source tree to move
wholesale.

## Directory ownership

| Directory | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `platform/` | Native ESP-IDF platform, boot, storage, update and hardware adapters |
| `runtime/` | MicroPython kernel, services, modules and user-facing adapters |
| `contracts/` | Versioned data exchanged across the native/runtime boundary |
| `host/` | Build, migration, signing, qualification and factory tooling |
| `tools/` | Alpha-only static and contract checks |

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Native code never imports application policy; MicroPython never manipulates
   OTA partitions, encrypted NVS internals or bootloader state directly.
2. Boundary values are bounded primitive data with a declared schema and ABI
   version. Raw ESP-IDF or MicroPython objects do not cross the boundary.
3. The operator installs one paired universal release. Platform and runtime
   components remain independently signed and independently recoverable.
4. A failed platform/runtime trial rolls back the pair.
5. Hardware capability, firmware inclusion, runtime integration and signed
   product policy are reported separately.
6. No v2 configuration is mutated until a v3 trial is confirmed. Migration is
   previewable, transactional and reversible.
7. Every alpha milestone has host, hardware-in-the-loop and recovery gates.

Read the [target architecture](../docs/V3_ARCHITECTURE.md),
[requirements](../docs/V3_REQUIREMENTS.md) and
[roadmap](../docs/V3_ROADMAP.md) before adding implementation code. The
[Alpha 12 test note](../docs/V3_ALPHA12.md) defines its exact scope and safe
test procedure. The [Alpha 11 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA11.md),
[Alpha 9 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA9.md),
[Alpha 8 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA8.md),
[Alpha 7 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA7.md), [Alpha 6 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA6.md),
[Alpha 5 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA5.md),
[Alpha 4 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA4.md),
[Alpha 3 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA3.md),
[Alpha 2 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA2.md) and
[Alpha 1 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA1.md) retain the preceding boundary history.
