# IoT-MD v3 greenfield alpha

This directory is the isolated starting point for the v3 architecture rewrite.
Stable v2.5 maintenance continues from `main`; v3 development continues on
`alpha/v3-platform-rewrite` until its own promotion gates pass.

Version `3.0.0-alpha.10` advances the native boundary to ABI 6. Its encrypted
paired-update journal binds a universal release to the running platform
partition and selected MicroPython runtime slot. The frozen supervisor,
production composition root, side-effect-free shadow runtime, fleet/migration
staging and complete driver-declaration bridge now represent all nine
greenfield implementation gates. These are implemented mechanisms, not
completed qualification claims. Native capability booleans and the
release-bound evidence ledger remain fail-closed, and the proven v2.5 product
runtime remains the active compatibility payload.

The rewrite keeps the proven product requirements while establishing the
native ESP-IDF platform and MicroPython application boundary before porting
features. Existing v2 code is reference behavior, not a source tree to move
wholesale.

## Directory ownership

| Directory | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `platform/` | Native ESP-IDF platform, boot, storage, update and hardware adapters |
| `runtime/` | MicroPython kernel, services, modules and user-facing adapters |
| `contracts/` | Versioned data exchanged across the native/runtime boundary |
| `host/` | Build, migration, signing, qualification and factory tooling |
| `tools/` | Alpha-only static and contract checks |

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Native code never imports application policy; MicroPython never manipulates
   OTA partitions, encrypted NVS internals or bootloader state directly.
2. Boundary values are bounded primitive data with a declared schema and ABI
   version. Raw ESP-IDF or MicroPython objects do not cross the boundary.
3. The operator installs one paired universal release. Platform and runtime
   components remain independently signed and independently recoverable.
4. A failed platform/runtime trial rolls back the pair.
5. Hardware capability, firmware inclusion, runtime integration and signed
   product policy are reported separately.
6. No v2 configuration is mutated until a v3 trial is confirmed. Migration is
   previewable, transactional and reversible.
7. Every alpha milestone has host, hardware-in-the-loop and recovery gates.

Read the [target architecture](../docs/V3_ARCHITECTURE.md),
[requirements](../docs/V3_REQUIREMENTS.md) and
[roadmap](../docs/V3_ROADMAP.md) before adding implementation code. The
[Alpha 10 test note](../docs/V3_ALPHA10.md) defines its exact scope and safe
test procedure. The [Alpha 9 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA9.md),
[Alpha 8 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA8.md),
[Alpha 7 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA7.md), [Alpha 6 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA6.md),
[Alpha 5 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA5.md),
[Alpha 4 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA4.md),
[Alpha 3 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA3.md),
[Alpha 2 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA2.md) and
[Alpha 1 note](../docs/V3_ALPHA1.md) retain the preceding boundary history.
