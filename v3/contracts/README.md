# Native/runtime contracts

Contracts are the compatibility boundary between the ESP-IDF platform and the
MicroPython runtime. Every contract has an integer ABI version, fixed limits,
explicit optional fields and fail-closed validation.

The executable contracts currently describe platform capabilities, paired
update state, runtime configuration, bounded kernel snapshots, unified
connectivity diagnostics, identity metadata, fleet reports, migration plans,
the supported driver catalog and release-bound qualification evidence. Alpha 2
defines the native whole-namespace snapshot calls:

- `storage_open(namespace)` returns an opaque bounded handle;
- `storage_snapshot(handle)` returns one generation and byte payload;
- `storage_commit(handle, expected_generation, payload)` performs a bounded
  compare-and-swap commit; and
- `storage_close(handle)` releases the process-local handle.

Alpha 3 adds the resource boundary:

- `resource_claim(kind, identifier, owner)` returns an opaque exclusive claim;
- `resource_release(handle)` releases one claim;
- `resource_release_owner(owner)` cleans up an application owner; and
- `resource_snapshot()` returns at most the advertised number of primitive
  claim records.

Alpha 4 adds a bounded diagnostic record for DNS, time, TLS, MQTT, CA, syslog
and release-service reachability. Product services exchange bounded request,
response and state values; socket and TLS objects remain inside adapters.

Alpha 5 advances runtime configuration to version 3. Identity records contain
only metadata and opaque certificate/key handles. Fleet reports expose bounded
inventory, release, health, canary and event-cursor values. Migration plans
record preview/staging state and opaque handles without embedding credentials,
keys or protected files. The driver catalog is static and modules may declare
multiple logical resources.

Alpha 6 adds a 15-gate qualification evidence contract. It preserves
`not-run`, `in-progress`, `passed` and `failed` as distinct states, binds the
campaign to one version and monotonic release sequence, and never treats an
unreachable probe as a health or storage observation. The beta profile also
requires sustained observation counts rather than accepting one late sample as
evidence for the complete soak.

Alpha 7 advances the native platform contract to ABI 4. OTA snapshots report
the running and next partitions as bounded labels and expose guarded confirm or
rollback eligibility. Native recovery records an explicit request, reason,
incomplete-boot count and reset reason in encrypted NVS before replaceable
product code loads. A fixed-capacity worker accepts only declared recovery and
OTA job kinds; completion events include a bounded identifier, state, numeric
error, retryability and diagnostic detail. The capability record separates
implemented mechanisms from HIL-qualified production claims.

Alpha 9 advances the native platform contract to ABI 5 and runtime
configuration to version 4. Resource claims declare exclusive or shared
ownership, a bounded compatibility signature and physical construction
parameters. Only I2C and SPI may be shared; the native implementation also
compares their effective pin, frequency and DMA parameters before reusing a
physical bus. Resource snapshots report constructed state, and GPIO interrupt
observations use the existing bounded event contract. `resource_reset()`
removes stale native ownership before a reconstructed MicroPython runtime starts
claiming peripherals. Production identity
records continue to expose metadata and opaque integers only; the adapter's
locator mapping is held in encrypted transactional storage.

Alpha 10 advances the native platform contract to ABI 6. The update capability
map declares `native_pair_journal`, and the runtime adapter exposes bounded
prepare, begin-trial, runtime-healthy, confirm, rollback-request and
rollback-complete operations. Pair snapshots contain identifiers, partition and
runtime-slot labels, health and bounded failure text; they never contain an OTA
handle. Confirmation fails unless the running partition and healthy runtime
match the persisted pair. Implementation presence remains separate from
release-bound qualification evidence.

Alpha 12 retains ABI 6. Frozen recovery code accesses that ABI directly when it
prepares the pair, so it does not depend on an application-slot adapter before
the slot is available. The native OTA-valid readback still precedes committing
the application pointer. The universal record persists each confirmation phase
and exact failure, and a higher signed release sequence may supersede a stale
native trial left by a rejected core.

Later qualification milestones must prove:

- power-loss-safe paired ownership and rollback on hardware;
- native recovery, job, resource and driver fault matrices;
- transport, identity, fleet and migration interoperability; and
- controlled active-v3 cutover with persistent compatibility fallback.

Schema files document values for host tools and tests. The native module and
MicroPython adapter will use generated/shared constants where practical rather
than separate hand-maintained interpretations.
